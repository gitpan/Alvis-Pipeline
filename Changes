Revision history for Perl extension Alvis::Pipeline.

0.10  Mon Aug 14 19:01:55 BST 2006
	- No significant changes to the library, but a major reworking
	  of the error-handing in zsink.pl:
	  * Unrecoverable errors now cause the zsink to be closed down
	    neatly, so that the spooling child process doesn't hang
	    around getting in the way when we try to re-start.
	  * ZOOM errors pertaining to a particular operation
	    (i.e. nine times out of ten, it's Zebra refusing to add a
	    wrongly-formatted record) are logged, but the zsink
	    continues to operate.
	  * The CONNECTION_LOST error, which occurs most often when
	    Zebra gets bored with inactivity and closes the socket,
	    causes an attempt to re-forge the connection.  This will
	    succeed immediately in the timeout case, and all will be
	    well, as the master Zebra will still be there and will
	    fork a new worker.  This will of course not succeed if
	    Zebra has been shut down completely -- but nor it should.

	- Add two additional programs to the "bin" directory:
	  alvis-pipeline-put-documents.pl -- similar to the existing
		alvis-pipeline-put.pl, but instead of generating a
		sequence of documents, feeds nominated files down the
		pipeline.
	  alvis-zsink.pl -- acts as a sink on the end of a pipeline,
		feeding the received documents to a Z39.50 server such
		as Zebra.

0.08  Mon Jul  3 12:22:11 BST 2006
	- Fix documentation of Alvis::Pipeline::Read->read(), which in
	  fact returns a string containing the XML document rather
	  than a DOM tree as previously claimed.
	- Fix sample code accordingly.
	- Add documentation of the pipeline protocol, to facilitate
	  the development of indepedent implementations in other
	  languages.

0.07  Tue Nov 22 15:05:30 GMT 2005
	- Add notes to the documentation about record identity and
	  indentifier.

0.06  Mon Oct 24 15:25:32 BST 2005
	- Both Read and Write pipes are now Unicode-clean, along with
	  the the temporary files spooled by the background reader.
	- New test-script t/2-unicode.t.

0.05  Mon Oct 10 15:18:29 BST 2005
	- Remove a test from t/0-creation.t that required a listening
	  server on localhost port 80 -- too many people inexplicably
	  do not run web servers :-)

0.04  Mon Oct  3 14:14:43 BST 2005
	- Total rewrite, not using OAI.  Much simpler and more reliable.
	- Better debugging output.
	- Better documentation.

0.03  Fri Sep 16 17:22:37 BST 2005
	- Fixes to documentation (dependencies listed in "README")
	- Added "INSTALL.Debian" file (Marc).

0.02  Fri Jun 17 19:30:13 BST 2005
	- First public release.

0.01  Wed May 18 14:23:38 BST 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X Alvis::Pipeline
