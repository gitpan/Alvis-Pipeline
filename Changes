Revision history for Perl extension Alvis::Pipeline.

0.08  Mon Jul  3 12:22:11 BST 2006
	- Fix documentation of Alvis::Pipeline::Read->read(), which in
	  fact returns a string containing the XML document rather
	  than a DOM tree as previously claimed.
	- Fix sample code accordingly.
	- Add documentation of the pipeline protocol, to facilitate
	  the development of indepedent implementations in other
	  languages.

0.07  Tue Nov 22 15:05:30 GMT 2005
	- Add notes to the documentation about record identity and
	  indentifier.

0.06  Mon Oct 24 15:25:32 BST 2005
	- Both Read and Write pipes are now Unicode-clean, along with
	  the the temporary files spooled by the background reader.
	- New test-script t/2-unicode.t.

0.05  Mon Oct 10 15:18:29 BST 2005
	- Remove a test from t/0-creation.t that required a listening
	  server on localhost port 80 -- too many people inexplicably
	  do not run web servers :-)

0.04  Mon Oct  3 14:14:43 BST 2005
	- Total rewrite, not using OAI.  Much simpler and more reliable.
	- Better debugging output.

0.03  Fri Sep 16 17:22:37 BST 2005

	- First public release.

0.01  Wed May 18 14:23:38 BST 2005

		-X Alvis::Pipeline
