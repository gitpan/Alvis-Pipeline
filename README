The Alvis::Pipeline module
==========================

This Perl module implements the Alvis pipeline.  Not the _stages_ of
the pipeline -- harvesting, semantic analysis, etc. -- those things
are done elsewhere by other partners.  This is the glue that makes up
the actual pipeline itself.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

You need the following modules installed:

IO::File
